# a)

# Which of the following statements regarding the probability density function of the normal distribution
# N(1, 2^2) is false?

  # 1. The total area under the curve is equal to 1.0
  # 2. The mean is equal to 1
  # 3. The variance is equal to 2
  # 4. The curve is symmetric about the mean
  # 5. The two tails of the curve extend indefinitely
  # 6. Don’t know

    # 3 variancen er 4

# b)

  # Let X be normally distributed with mean 24 and variance 16
  # Calculate the following probabilities:

  # – P(X ≤ 20)
    pnorm(20,24, 4)
    # [1] 0.1586553

  # – P(X > 29.5)
    1 - pnorm(29.5,24, 4)
    # [1] 0.08456572

  # – P(X = 23.8)
    # 0, et punkt er altid 0.
